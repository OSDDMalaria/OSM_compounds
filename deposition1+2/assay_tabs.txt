6	1	"Late stage gametocyte: http://malaria.ourexperiment.org/uri/e2: Compound is added to 384 well imaging plates containing 20,000 highly synchronous late stage IV gametocytes. The plates are incubated for 72 hours in standard incubation conditions (5%CO2, 5%O2, 37oC, 5% humidity). After incubation the viability marker MitoTracker Red CM-H 2 XRos is added to the wells. The plates are then imaged on the OPERA confocal high-throughput imaging system. The images obtained are then analysed using an algorithm for determining the number of viable gametocytes still remaining in the compound treated wells based on viability marker fluorescent intensity and the morphology of the GFP expressing parasite."
