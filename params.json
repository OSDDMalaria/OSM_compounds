Any results are both academically and commercially exploitable by whoever wishes to do so, provided the project is cited.\r\n\r\n### Raw Data\r\nWe are currently using GitHub to host the raw data for our project. A database of all OSM compounds synthesised and/or tested to date can be found on our pages in both SDF and Excel versions.\r\n\r\n### Document Sharing\r\nOver the coming months we will be experimenting in using GitHub to share documents and workflows to see if we can use GitHub as a project management tool\r\n\r\n### Contributing Authors\r\nMatthew H.
