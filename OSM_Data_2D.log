Importing SDFile C:\Users\Murray\Documents\Sydney\OSDD Malaria\SDF Data\OSM_compounds\OSM_Data_2D.sdf
Overwriting database C:\Users\Murray\Documents\Sydney\OSDD Malaria\SDF Data\OSM_compounds\OSM_Data_2D.mdb
Database version: ChemFinder 12.0; Mst version: 74
Starting at beginning -- line 1.
Redundant reagents will only be stored once.
A ChemDraw-style (CDX) version will only be stored where distinct from the ChemFinder version.
